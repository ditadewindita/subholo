# Subholo
Created with :heart:, Unity, C#, and Microsoft Visual Studio at HackGT by Erin Yoo, Osmar Coronel, & Haerunnisa Dewindita 

The subtitles and speech to text recognition was created through Unity and C# using the [DictationRecognizer](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Windows.Speech.DictationRecognizer.html) script built into Unity while the application was deployed from Unity and the computer to the HoloLens itself using Microsoft Visual Studio.
